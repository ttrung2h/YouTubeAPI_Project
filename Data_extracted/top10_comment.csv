I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform.

Candidly, this is a completely different world from an artificial environment such as a DataCamp or other fill-in-the-blank approach.  Filling in blanks does not teach our brains to demonstrate the real-world competency that our future team is depending on from us :)\n\nIn learning engineering lingo, we call this disconnect the difference between the ""learning context"" vs. the real-world ""performance context"".  The goal of solid training is to first teach the basics but ensure that learners demonstrate mastery (whether basic or advanced) in a real world context.  In the case of those of us who want jobs in this field it will be necessary to communicate what is going on in our brains just as you do in this video.  To be super transparent with you and others reading this... In my first such interview I candidly felt like a 2nd grader learning phonics and sounding out words... which was an unpleasant feeling to put it mildly.\n\nHaving to ""talk through"" a completely new SQL problem in real-time is very much a performance, and having a way to simulate this in real-time would be helpful.   \nYou demonstrated this competency in this video, and that helps to a significant degree. Some sort of service or ""fishbowl"" style masterclass could also accomplish this.  \n\nThe ""community answers"" feature in StrataScratch is new and very helpful as there is more than one solution to these issues.

It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found.

So in the first question, as the budget increased, what happened to revenue? It increased. But with country, company, or other categorical variables, correlations don\'t make sense. The values for country and company are random, so the numbers that represent them going up doesn\'t tell us anything. It\'s no wonder then, that the correlations weren\'t large. \n\nInstead, it would make sense to do a t-test or ANOVA and compare means.

It\'s important to remember that a confidence interval is not guaranteed to overlap the true, population mean. A 95% CI means that if we make a ton of CIs using the same method, 95% of them will overlap the true mean. This tells us that 5% of the time we\'ll be off. So yes, a sample that is totally bonkers is possible, but rare. Understanding this risk of making the wrong decision, and managing it, is what statistics is all about.\nAlso, at 5:55 I say there are up to 8^8 combinations of observed values and possible means, but this assumes that order matters, and it doesn\'t.

And in that case,  the candidate alpha values might be in larger or smaller number than the possible number of trees in the CVFTs at hand.\nI imagine that a possible answer is that the number of members in a CVFTs can actually be different than the number of candidate alphas, and that the pruned tress in a CVFTs are actually identified through their Tree Scores when each of the alpha candidate values is applied -- and if so I guess the issue is that perhaps this mechanism does not stand out 100% from the presentation... \n\nSecond question: if we assess the trees in each CVFTs only by their SSRs, wouldn\'t always the tree with more leaves (therefore alpha=0) win?\n\nThanks much', 'HI Josh, do you have a copy of the dataset used in this example?']"

Going forward all subsequent stumps will only work on smaller and smaller subsets, making it a bit confusing for me on how to ensure good randomness.\n1. Do we also restart from the updated sample weights at 16:00 and redo sampling, thereby creating multiple different datasets but using the same sample weight values? This will probably ensure we use all the data from the original data set in some instances.\n2. As a follow-up to Q1, do we perform multiple sampling at different levels to get more variations in the dataset before creating stumps? In the video, you described only one instance of sampling using new weights but I assume it needs to be performed multiple times to get variations in datasets.\n3. Do we not sample from distribution at the very beginning also? All sample weights will have the same value but random sampling would mean some might not make it to the first round of ( stump creation + Amount of say + New sample weights ) itself to get unequal sample weights at 16:00.

Remember, the goal of lambda is not to give us the optimal fit, but to prevent overfitting.

For example, if we had a uniform distribution and we collected 20 values from it and calculated the mean, then that mean would be normally distributed.

318,ARfXDSkQf1Y,"['NOTE: In statistics, machine learning and many programming languages, like Java, R and Python, the default base for the log function is \'e\'. So log(0.17) = ""log base e of 0.17"" = -1.77. The natural log (log to base \'e\') is used because it often simplifies the mathematics that underpins statistics. That said, you can use whatever base you would like as long as you are consistent.\nAlso, at 10:00, I say that a histogram of the log(odds) has the shape of a normal distribution, but what I should have said is that the shape is *similar* to a normal distribution and is *approximated* with a normal distribution.\nLastly, people often ask about how to generate the normal distribution: First, I randomly selected a number between 1 and 100 and I get 32. That means I will use 32 as the numerator for the odds. The denominator is then 100-32 = 68. Then I calculate the log(32 / 68) and get -0.75 (because I use log base \'e\', but you can use any log base as long as you are consistent). Then I pick another random number between 1 and 100 and get 54. This means that the numerator for my odds is 54 and the denominator is 100-54 = 46. So I calculate the log(54 / 46)=0.16. Then I just repeat that process a bunch of times (100s) and draw a histogram of the log(odds) values. If I do this, I will get a normal distribution.\n\nSupport StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/', 'nice', '8:28 I think you meant ln(6) is 1,79 instead of log(6).', ""How is the log of 0.17 = to -1.79? it's not making sense.

Regardless of the number of dimensions, all principal components are perpendicular to each other. If that sounds insane, consider a 2-d graph, the x and y axes are perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 3-d graph, the x, y and z axes are all perpendicular to each other. Now consider a 4-d graph..... etc.\nNOTE 3: A lot of people ask about the covariance matrix. There are two ways to do PCA: 1) The old way, which applies eigen-decomposition to the covariance matrix and 2) The new way, which applies singular value decomposition to the raw data. This video describes the new way, which is preferred because, from a computational stand point, it is more stable.\nNOTE 4: A lot of people ask how fitting this line is different from Linear Regression. In Linear Regression we are trying to maintain a relationship between a value on the x-axis, and the value it would predict on the y-axis. In other words, the x-axis is used to predict values on the y-axis. This is why we use the vertical distance to measure error - because that tells us how far off our prediction is for the true value. In PCA, no such relationship exists, so we minimize the perpendicular distances between the data and the line.\n\nSupport StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/', 'Excellent video!

We can repeatedly keep taking the sample means and then plot all these sample means in a histogram and we would observe a normal distribution called the sampling distribution of the sample means. The mean of this distribution would be a better estimate of the population mean and its standard deviation, called standard error would be the population standard deviation/sqrt (number of points in a sample). Won't the confidence interval(say 95%) range be (sampling distribution mean - 2  SE,sampling distribution mean + 2  SE) instead of (point estimate - 2  SE,point estimate + 2  SE)?\r\n\r\nWhy would we use the sample mean(point estimate) in calculating the confidence interval range?

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. \n\nDo any of you need prayer?\n\n\n\nY""]"

Analysis can be done to find out the reason for low sales in the bottom 5 (any number) customers/countries/zones. This insight can lead to actions to boost sales.\n\n3. We can have a table to capture the service requests logged by customers along with priority and other related details and add relevant reports to the dashboard. \n\n4. Scheduled delivery date can be added for each order and actual delivery date to know if there's a delay in the order.\n\n5. Another table can be added to capture the order details.  A report for the top 5 orders can be added to the dashboard.\n\n6. Customers can be categorized into Gold, Silver, and Copper and relevant reports can be added for each category of customers.\n\n7. Predictive analysis can be done to predict the sales for top 5(or any) customers/zones/countries and the sales team can get ready to ship the items accordingly. These reports can be published to the Sales team. \n\n8. Table to capture rating for products similar to how Amazon captures ratings and reviews. This will help Atliq Hardware business owners to decide whether the same items should be continued for procurement. In case they are manufactured by Atliq, they can decide if there should be any enhancement to the features to satisfy the customers.\n\n9. One report for returned items with the reason for the return can be added too. This will give insights if the low sales are related to returned items for a customer.\n\n10. Different BINs can be added for trend reports and top reports on the dashboard. However, it will be good, if the reports loaded can be tied to the role of the user logged in. For example,  trend reports and top customer/country/zone reports can be shown for the executives and sales prediction reports can be loaded for the sales team.\n\n11.

Your explanation is gold!', 'I think one important part of statistics a lot of people overlook is simply all of the assumptions being made behind the scenes. There are so many cases where you may use a particular test or model (even simple linear regression) where there are assumptions being made about sample size, normality, equal variance of residuals, etc., where you won‚Äôt get any warning or error in your code but the results may be untrustworthy because one or more assumptions are being violated. Always know what assumptions are being made when you implement certain methods, and to what degree these methods are robust to violations! It could mean the difference of being able to fit a desired model on the data directly, or needing to manipulate the data/methods drastically to be able to trust the results. Just because you see statistical significance does not mean something is significant, it means it is significant given all these other facts about the data hold true']"

I would try the problems, do a few easy ones and give up. What I should have done is re-read the section in light of what I encountered in the problems. In a well tested course, the clues to do the homework are in the reading assignment. Keep re-reading until you find the clue or hint; this is likely to be a minor detail on first reading. If there are special cases, think like a computer programmer and how one would code them as ""IF"" statements.  In your certificate program, if hundreds of students have done it before you, the information you need to solve the problem should be in the lectures or reading. Don\'t be afraid to listen to the lecture twice and read four or five times (with breaks in between) and then for error messeges there is always Google. But, when you are doing your own independent project, there is no guarantee that the information you need is in the days readings and you do not have step by step instructions (unless you have written them yourself -- a good idea BTW). You have to decide what method to use because it is not necessarily given in an assignment. You gain an entirely different perspective.', ""I recomend taking at least one college level introductory statistics class (or high school AP statistics class).\nIf yoiu survive the statistics class; any certificate program will be easier (and more fun) by comparison.\nThe problem is that traditional statistics classes have nuggets of vital information buried under unnecessary hand calculations and enormous amount of confusing details. But, if you survive the statistics course and remember the top two levels of the outline (don't worry about the third level of the outline) you will be well prepared (in terms of basic statistics) for the certificate program. Cerfificate programs tend to have the opposite problem, they tend to be very  heavy on computer programming, homework but light on the concepts.
