The first questions we look at are Phone interview questions which are generally more broad questions. Then we look at In-Person interview questions which are typically more technical and specific. 

You may get some technical questions during your interview or none at all! It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.

I hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!

191,EzjtTh-WUWY,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,2022-10-18T15:55:23Z,Live Stream - More details about Target Encoding/AMA/Silly Songs,"Over the years a lot of people have asked me to talk about a machine learning method called CatBoost. One CatBoot's things is to use a unique approach to Target Encoding. Today we'll (hopefully) talk about that method, but if not, at least we'll take a big step towards talking about it.

192,Za9wm6HWkvo,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,2022-10-05T04:00:22Z,Live Stream - Target Encoding/AMA/Silly Songs!!!,"A lot of machine learning algorithms can not deal with categorical data (like ""favorite color"" or ""country code"") directly. As a result, we have translate them into some sort of numerical value. The most common practice is to use something called One-Hot-Encoding, which is fine if you don't have many options for each category. However, if you have a lot of options, things get out of hand quickly. This is where methods like Target Encoding really start to shine, so that's what we'll talk about today. We'll also have time for any question you might have for me and maybe even a few silly songs! TRIPLE BAM!!!

It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

It provides us an easy way to get a sense of what might happen if we could repeat an experiment a bunch of times. It turns point estimates into distributions that can be used to calculate all kinds of stuff, including standard errors, confidence intervals and even p-values. In this video, we show how it can be used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals. In Part 2, we'll see how to calculate p-values.

216,OSPr6G6Ka-U,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,2021-06-22T04:00:06Z,Expected Values for Continuous Variables!!!,"If you ever muck around in statistics, it's not long before you see E(x) = something. These are expected values. Expected Values for Continuous Variables are a little trickier than their discrete counterparts because we have to do some calculus. However, I'll walk you through it, one step at a time, so don't sweat it! BAM!

NOTE: This one is, believe it or not, pretty near to my heart. When I was taking Statistical Theory in graduate school (from Rodger Berger of Casella and Berger, who wrote the standard textbook on statistical theory, ""Statistical Inference"") I remember having a lot of trouble with expected values. They intimidated me for two reasons 1) deriving them seemed like total luck and 2) I never understood, exactly, what the formula for continuous variables meant in a deep way. I could look at the equation and name the parts, but that was all I could do. Anyway, fast forward a few years and here I am, going back to these basics, this time determined to get that ""deep understanding"" I missed before, and, at least for myself, I succeeded. And I hope that means other people will also be able to get a deep understanding of expected values as well.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes that you are already familiar with the concept of an Expected Value. If not, check out the 'Quest: https://youtu.be/KLs_7b7SKi4

Everyone says Neural Networks are ""black boxes"", but that's not true at all. In this video I break each piece down and show how it works, step-by-step, using simple mathematics that is still true to the algorithm. By the end of this video you will have a deep understanding of what Neural Networks do.

284,2xudPOBz-vs,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,2019-04-01T23:00:02Z,Gradient Boost Part 2 (of 4): Regression Details,"Gradient Boost is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms in use. And get this, it's not that complicated! This video is the second part in a series that walks through it one step at a time. This video focuses on the original Gradient Boost algorithm used to predict a continuous value, like someone's weight. We call this, ""using Gradient Boost for Regression"". In part 3, we'll walk though how Gradient Boost classifies samples into two different categories, and in part 4, we'll go through the math again, this time focusing on classification.

This StatQuest assumes that you have already watched Part 1:
https://youtu.be/3CC4N4z3GJc

...it also assumes that you know about Regression Trees:
https://youtu.be/g9c66TUylZ4

...and, while it required, it might be useful if you understood Gradient Descent: https://youtu.be/sDv4f4s2SB8

This StatQuest is based on the following sources:

A 1999 manuscript by Jerome Friedman that introduced Stochastic Gradient Boost: https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf

The Wikipedia article on Gradient Boosting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting
NOTE: The key to understanding how the wikipedia article relates to this video is to keep reading past the ""pseudo algorithm"" section. The very next section in the article called ""Gradient Tree Boosting"" shows how the algorithm works for trees (which is pretty much the only weak learner people ever use for gradient boost, which is why I focus on it in the video). In that section, you see how the equation is modified so that each leaf from a tree can have a different output value, rather than the entire ""weak learner"" having a single output value - and this is the exact same equation that I use in the video.
Later in the article, in the section called ""Shrinkage"", they show how the learning rate can be included. Since this is also pretty much always used with gradient boost, I simply included it in the base algorithm that I describe.

6:30 Step 1: Initialize the model with a constant value
9:10 Step 2: Build M trees
10:01 Step 2.A: Calculate residuals
12:47 Step 2.B: Fit a regression tree to the residuals

20:38 Step 2.D: Update predictions with the new tree
23:19 Step 2: Summary of step 2
24:59 Step 3: Output the final prediction

Corrections:
4:27 The sum on the left hand side should be in parentheses to make it clear that the entire sum is multiplied by 1/2, not just the first term.
15:47. It should be R_jm, not R_ij. 
16:18, the leaf in the script is R_1,2 and it should be R_2,1.
21:08. With regression trees, the sample will only go to a single leaf, and this summation simply isolates the one output value of interest from all of the others. However, when I first made this video I was thinking that because Gradient Boost is supposed to work with any ""weak learner"", not just small regression trees, that this summation was a way to add flexibility to the algorithm.
24:15, the header for the residual column should be r_i,2.

Two months ago (in December) I was working on my annual cover song, Taylor Swift's ""Wildest Dreams"" https://youtu.be/F7Gqjbg3bWI  , a song about how she wants her soon to be ex-lover to remember her, and I was wondering about the other side of the story. Specifically, I was thinking about Swift's line in the last chorus, ""Say you'll remember me even if it's just pretend"". I thought to myself, ""what if I wrote a song about some guy who's 'pretending'?"", and the thought made me laugh out loud. So here's my song about ""pretending"".

Here, take this cup have a drink from the well
Then lend me your ear I’ve a story to tell
Not long ago there was a castle and a prince
And a maiden so fair all surrounded by a fence

Inside those walls the gardens grew lush and green
But the walls themselves were a sight so obscene
A head on each post they were a warning to us all
To keep on our side not to question the wall

A knight from our side saw the maiden from afar
(And) he was drawn to the fence like a moth to a star
So he climbed up the wall and made his way across the lawn
But the prince acted fast and stabbed the knight before the dawn

So look over there, you’ll see his head upon a post
And this is what he said before he gave up the ghost
“Alas, sweet revenge won’t be a story I can tell
but I saw the maiden put poison in the well.”

Sort of like a Broadway Musical and a Three Ring Circus all wrapped up into one big bonanza.

Combined with Cross Validation, it's how we decide which machine learning method would be best for our dataset. Check out the video to find out how!

NOTE: This video illustrates the confusion matrix concept as described in the Introduction to Statistical Learning, page 145.

Correction:
4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

304,OxA6i3iJd7M,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,2018-09-01T00:51:18Z,Miss Carolina,"Here's song #68! The song had two sources of inspiration:

#1: A Gillian Welch song called ""Look at Miss Ohio"", that has the lines:

Oh me oh my oh
Look at Miss Ohio
She’s a running around with her rag-top down
She says ""I wanna do right but not right now""

...anyway - I was biking home from work and I was standing at the intersection of Henderson and Rosemary and I thought of that song and I started to sing about ""Miss North Carolina"" as if she were some sort of trouble maker. From there it turned into ""I miss Carolina, when am I gonna head back home"" - a song about a North Carolina exile that wants to come home. So, that was inspiration #1.

#2 Once I had this idea of ""I miss Carolina"", I started to think about all the political rabble rousing that's going on in the state - and this was before the Silent Sam thing happened (a bunch of people knocked over Silent Sam a few weeks ago) - they've got these crazy state constitutional amendments that are coming out of no where that we are supposed to vote on. One of them declares that ""hunting and fishing will be the primary means for managing fish and wildlife populations"". Stupid stuff that seems like old folk trying to make it harder to young folk to get anything done in the state. So then the song went back to ""Miss Carolina"" - she being the true spirit of the state - she's gone and left us all covered in pretty weeds, but still weeds.

NOTE: I specifically used the antiquated term ""Miss"" instead of the more modern ""Ms"" because ""Miss"" is still used for beauty pageants - when the state picks the woman who most embodies the ""spirit"" of the state - she's beautiful, but also smart, caring and determined to change the world for the better. She's the one that's gone and we need her back.

We start by importing a dataset and cleaning it up, then we perform logistic regression on a very simple model, followed by a fancy model. Lastly we draw a graph of the predicted probabilities that came from the Logistic Regression.

The code that I use in this video can be found on the StatQuest GitHub:

Here's a gentle introduction to the subject that covers the basics behind the experiment, how the data is processed and the sorts of things you can do with it.

It's based on the original RNA-seq StatQuest, so make sure you watch that first (or at least are all ready totally down with that material):

It can be used to identify patterns in highly complex datasets and it can tell you what variables in your data are the most important. Lastly, it can tell you how accurate your new understanding of the data actually is.

In this video, I go one step at a time through PCA, and the method used to solve it, Singular Value Decomposition. I take it nice and slowly so that the simplicity of the method is revealed and clearly explained.

Here's one of those tricky little things, Probability vs. Likelihood. In common conversation we use these words interchangeably. However, statisticians make a clear distinction that is important to understand if you want to follow their logic. The good news is that they are both super simple. The bad news is that they are easy to get mixed up. The StatQuest gives you visual images that make them both easy to remember so you'll always keep them straight.

5:41 Definition of Bagging
6:03 Evaluating a Random Forest
8:34 Optimizing the Random Forest

Corrections:
3:18 I should have said the same feature (or variable) can be selected multiple times in a tree. Every time we select a subset of features to choose from, we choose from the full list of features, even if we have already used some of those features. Thus, a single feature can appear multiple times in a tree.

Here are the lyrics:

When I am feeling down
When I am exhausted
When I am at my end (again)
When I have been broken

When I am feeling scared
When I’m full of worries
When I can only doubt (myself)
You come to me
You come to me
You comfort me

When I am overwhelmed
When sadness becomes me
When the simplest of things
Brings me to ruin

A feather in the wind
and life turns to ashes
When the things I love can’t last
You come to me
You come to me
You comfort me

When you are in my arms
Your head on my shoulder (near my heart)
When I feel you close to me
When you ease my burden

When you hold my hand
It feels right for the first time.
When you smile at me
You bring me calm
You bring me calm
You comfort me

If you want the code that I used in this video, you can get it from the StatQuest GitHub: https://github.com/StatQuest/mds_and_pcoa_demo/blob/master/mds_and_pcoa_demo.R

There really only one small difference, but that difference means you need to know what you're doing if you're going to use MDS effectively. This video make sure you learn what you need to know to use MDS and PCoA.

There is a minor error at 4:14: The difference for gene 3 should be (2.2 - 1)². Instead the distance for gene 2 was repeated.

For example, you might collect some data and wonder if it is normally distributed. A QQ plot will help you answer that question. You can also use QQ plots to compare to different datasets that you collected to determine if their distributions are comparable. This video shows you how to do both things.

NOTE: The data in this video are measures of gene expression. If ""gene expression"" doesn't mean anything to you, just imagine that the data represents how tall a bunch of people are, or how much they weigh. Then consider the y-axis to be the height or weight of the people, and the x-axis just represents all of the data you collected on a single day. In this case, all of the data were collected on the same day, so they form a single column.

Here’s how to create a t-SNE graph in R (this is copied from the help file for Rtsne)…

library(""Rtsne"")
iris_unique &lt;- unique(iris) # Remove duplicates
iris_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(iris_unique[,1:4])
set.seed(42) # Set a seed if you want reproducible results
tsne_out &lt;- Rtsne(iris_matrix) # Run TSNE

# Show the objects in the 2D tsne representation
plot(tsne_out$Y,col=iris_unique$Species)

This StatQuest is based on the original t-SNE manuscript, and it's not super hard to read (especially if you understand the general idea of how it works): https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf

Correction:
9:28 I have log(reads for gene X) - log(average for gene X), but it should be: log(reads for gene X) - average(log values for gene for gene X). We are subtracting the geometric mean from each gene measurement. In other words, if you take 'the average of reads' to be the geometric average, it all hangs neatly together.

Correction:
4:15 I say getting 7 oranges and 1 blue is just as rare a getting 7 blues and 1 red. This is incorrect, since there are more blues and oranges in general than there are blues and red. However, the idea that we add up rarer events is correct.

This is the most conservative, and if you can show significance, you know your data is rock solid.
In MS Excel, this means setting ""Tails = 2"" and ""Type = 3"".

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

Papai Noel
He’s the surfing the waves
He’s got his speedo on, and he’s got his shades

He shaved his beard last week
‘Cause it’s just too warm
This is the mid-summer heat
Not a midwinter storm.

We got people singing Noite Feliz
We just finished plugging in our electrical tree

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

When he’s not hanging dez
Papai’s in Greenland
Fezzik’s employed making
presents by hand

Check out the presépio
It’s bad to the bone
You’ve got your amigo secreto
So you’re never alone

The missa do galo was crazy it lasted all night
Let’s eat a feijoada til we see the morning light

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

I see the world the way I want to see the world from over here. 
Everything is clear. 
You see the world the way you want to see the world from over there. 
In your rocking chair. 

So we might fight 
All night 
But that’s alright with me. 

I ride a bike you drive a truck I shake my fist up in the air. 
To let you know I care 
You leave your trash out on the curb for weeks on end it makes me mad. 
I bet that makes you glad 

You stay up late I go to bed I hear the noise right through the wall. 
I give the cops a call. 
I’m up at 5 it’s time for work when the cops arrive and take me in. 
Oh not again! 

I get back home my fingers crossed but I’m not alone you’re still around. 
Sitting on the ground. 
We’ve tried to be apart but there’s nothing’s worse than a lonely heart I guess I see. 
You’re the one for me.

Metaverse is the future of the internet, the future of everything!” Many tech CEOs have quoted this in one or the other way. But what exactly is Metaverse? Watch this video to know everything you ever wanted to know about the future of the internet. In simple words, the metaverse is the next generation internet technology that is to improve the current 2D experience, by making it more realistic. How exactly does this happen? It is as simple as wearing a VRS headset. The next milestone of this will be a physical touch experience through the 3D world.

With this, our remote working style is much more likely to revolutionize and not be restricted to the 2D rectangular box. It won't be only restricted to the people of IT & software industry but also factory workers will be able to enjoy the privilege of working from home. With this, the remote working culture will be in boom and thus allowing people from lower opportunity regions to get hired across the world.

Also, the boom of the metaverse is likely to bring in many career opportunities. With the possible evolution of metaverse apps, the demand for metaverse app developers is also likely to be increasing. Following this, the career opportunities for blockchain developers and cyber security engineers are also likely to have a hike. When talking about creating real life in the digital world, the role of a digital artist is inevitable. Data scientists, data analysts, and ML engineers are going to be in huge demand, given the fact that there will be a lot of data created and an ever-growing demand for applying AI and data science on various use cases. Metaverse is going to build a great platform for educational creators, who can then be able to conduct 3D live virtual classes.

However, with the good comes a bad part too. Keep watching this video to know about the possible negative impacts of the metaverse. Note, these are only my point of view. Metaverse is a rising wave and we have to either learn to fight it or surf through it.

Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Tableau can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

To address this we use a technique called data augmentation in deep learning. Data augmentation is used to generate new training samples from current training set using various transformations such as scaling, rotation, contrast change etc. In this video, we will classify flower images and see how our cnn model overfits. After that we will use data augmentation to generate new training samples and see how model performance improves.

Insertion sort requires many swaps and comparisons if heavy elements are located towards the end of an array. Shell sort will initially sort subarrays that are equal distance apart. The distance here is referred to as a gap. We will than keep on reducing the gap until it is 1. With gap=1 it becomes insertion sort but this time due to optimization we have performed earlier, sorting the array would require very less  comparisons and element swaps.

Often interviewers ask questions around quick sort in software engineering interviews. This technique uses divide and conquer approach to divide given list into partitions and then recursively sort these partitions. It starts with a pivot element and tries to put pivot element in its correct position. This video goes over theory and two popular partition schemes called hoare partition and lomuto partition. We will write code to implement quick sort algorithm in python. In the end I have an exercise for you to solve.

We are using 60000 small images for classification. These images can be  classified in one of the 10 categories below,
classes = [""airplane"",""automobile"",""bird"",""cat"",""deer"",""dog"",""frog"",""horse"",""ship"",""truck""]
Here is the dataset link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
We will use simple artificial neural network (we are not using CNN, usually CNN is preferred for image classification but since we have not covered that in our deep learning playlist so far we will be happy with simple ANN that still gives pretty high accuracy).

Tensorboard is a tool that comes with tensorflow and it allows you to visualize neural network as well as how it trains itself. This tool is very helpful in debugging issues too. We will use the notebook that we created in previous videos for recognizing handwritten digits and visualize accuracy,loss with every epoch using tensorboard. We will also look at the visual graphs of neural network along with some internal computations.

Tips for writing clean code: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/TechTopics/CodingBestPractices/coding_best_practices.md
Software architecture blog: https://martinfowler.com/
Competitive coding websites: leetcode, hackerrank, geeksforgeeks, careercup

1. Making initial conversation on resume effective
 1.1) Mention only those things on resume that you feel comfortable talking about, for projects that you mentioned on resume you should be able to draw tech arch diagram and talk through various business as well as technical aspects. Like why did you choose given architecture, No SQL vs SQL etc
  - Fresher: college projects
  - Experienced: Projects in past companies
 1.2) Why did you apply in our company? Say you applied in blackhawknetwork, they will ask you ""why blackhawknetwork?"". To respond to this question you need to know about company's products, clients and culture. You can use following resources to gain this knowledge,
  - Company's website, Google
  - Glassdoor
  - Linkedin: Connect with people working in that company 
 1.3) Tell something about yourself
  - Mention your passions any achievements (like opensource contributions, any achievements in projects)

2. Master competitive coding
 2.1) You can use these websites for practice: leetcode, careercup, geeksforgeek, glassdoor
 2.2) Don't make assumptions, ask smart counter questions. They want to check given a vague requirement how can you dig the details and transition from vague to concrete
 2.3) Data structure: Same problem can be solved using two different data structure but one DS might be more efficient than others
 2.4) Clean and effective coding
  - proper variable, class names 
  - modularize code using functions,classes
  - compact coding (use code review guidelines github page)
 
3. Mastering questions related to data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, design
 3.1) Again refer to glassdoor, careercup, leetcode for questions
 3.2) Experienced programmer: design questions 
  - Design messenger
  - Design facebook
  - This will cover things such as overall system design, databases, caching, scalability, class design, distributed computing
 
4. Communication, confidence and body language
 4.1) Be confident, don't have a guilt if you answer something wrong
 4.2) If you don't know about some topic be honest and say I've not worked on Redis but I know about cache little bit and I am ready to learn

5. Asking smart questions on the role and the company
 - What tech stack do you use in your team and in the company in general?
 - What type of problems your company or your team solves? 
 - What are growth and learning opportunities?
 - Will I get a chance to contribute to open source?
 - Which team you are working on and do you enjoy working here and why?
 - What are some of the good aspects of working here?

Now just a disclaimer, in order to learn deep learning you don't need to have such an expensive setup. Whatever laptop or personal computer you have should still work ok. If you have a requirements for running heavy jobs, you can utilize cloud for that. For me, NVIDIA gave 2500$ Titan RTX GPU for free and than I spent close to 1000$ for other parts to build this PC. My plan is to run some heavy deep learning jobs on this computer and I will be making videos on that in future.

This is also an implementation of a logistic regression in python from scratch. You know that logistic regression can be thought of as a simple neural network. The pre requisite for this tutorial is the previous tutorial on gradient descent (link below). We will be using gradient descent python funciton written in previous video to implement our own custom neural network class.

We will go over various loss functions in this video such as mean absolute error (a.k.a MAE), mean squared error (a.k.a MSE), log loss or binary cross entropy. After going through theory we will implement these loss functions in python. It is important to go through this implementation as it might be useful during your interviews (if you are targeting a role of a data scientist or a machine learning engineer)

We will use insurance dataset as a sample and build a logistic regression. Logistic regression uses two step process for classification,
step 1: linear regression to find best fit line for given dataset
step 2: sigmoid or logit function to convert this line into values between 0 and 1
Using sigmoid function one can do a classification.

In this deep learning tutorial python, I will cover following things in this video,
00:00 Introduction 
00:24 Data growth
01:25 Hardware advancements
02:40 Python and opensource ecosystem
04:00 Cloud and AI boom

I remember I did a project in my college 17 years ago and implemented error backpropogation algorithm in C++. Why is it that deep learning is taking off in recent years? The data growth due to IT adoption, IOT devices, social media is generating so much truth so that deep learning algorithms can really produce useful results. Neural network and deep learning shows its real power when training data size is huge. Due to advancements in hardwares such as GPU and TPUs one can run so many computations in parallel making it possible to run deep learning training in a reasonable amount of time. Python and opensource ecosystem on the other hand reduced the barries for people who don't know programming and they can  try python with pytorch or tensorflow and write deep learning programs easily. One doesn't need to buy expensive hardware, they can rent a machine in a cloud and can still write machine learning programs. There is a prevalent AI boom in the businesses nowadays where all business executives want to benefit from artificial intelligence. This further accelerates the growth of deep learning.

Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

768,xucm6_BQPJU,codebasics,2020-06-22T13:00:10Z,Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Data Science,"Artificial intelligence is a field where set of techniques are used to make computers as smart as humans. There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. 
Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

We will then use GridSearchCV and try different models with different hyper parameters to come up with a best model that can give us maximum accuracy. We will use sklearn classification_report to check the performance. Once we select best model based on GridSearchCV we can evaluate it on X_test and y_test to get a feel of how it is going to perform in production. Confusion matrix is used with seaborn visualization to get an understanding of classification errors for each of the classes. In the end we export the model to a file using joblib.

We mostly identify a person in a photo with a face. Hence we will use opencv and a technique called haar cascades to detect if a face and two eyes are clearly visible or not. If they are than we keep the image otherwise we discard the image. Majority of the data cleaning work will be done using python code but there will be some cleaning work that we will have to do manually.

If companies are paying so high for data scientist jobs, it must be not very easy to become a data scientist. However many times people live in inferiority complex thinking that they are not good at math, statistics, or programming hence they can't become data scientist even though they have a passion in this field. My suggestion is to ask yourself ""have you followed the right resources to learn data science skills?"" For example, to learn math I always advise people to use these resources,
Great resources to learn math:
https://www.mathsisfun.com/
https://www.khanacademy.org/
3b1b youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw

Also for python programming, this tutorial playlist is something that even middle school student can follow along easily,
Python tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

Other than following the right resources one needs to ask if you are right-brained or left-brained person. Are you interested in data science and analytical job? Data scientist job is so much in demand and there is a lot of competition so certainly, while it is not easy to become a data scientist if you are committed and ready to do hard work with a lot of discipline it is certainly not very hard as well.

The formula for IQR is very simple. IQR = Q3-Q1. Where Q3 is 75th percentile and Q1 is 25th percentile. Once you have IQR you can find upper and lower limit by removing this formula,
lower_limit = Q1-1.5*IQR
upper_limit = Q3 +1.5*IQR
Anything less than a lower limit or above the upper limit is considered outlier. We will use python pandas to remove outliers on a sample dataset and in the end, as usual, I have an interesting exercise for you to practice

They are useful in implementing set/map class in different programming languages. They provide efficient way of search an element in log n complexity. There are various traversal schemes you can use such as breadth first search and depth first search. In depth first search you can use in order traversal, pre order traversal and post order traversal schemes that will benefit in different scenarious. For example  in order traversal gives you a sorted list of elements in a tree. After going through theory we will implement binary tree, rather binary search tree in python.

But unlike array, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. They are instead chained by an element storing address location of next element. This makes insertion very easy. Also unlike dynamic arrays you don't have to pre-allocate some memory capacity. In this tutorial we will go through some theory first and then write python code to implement linked list. In the end we have an interesting exercise for you to solve.

One can not become a good programmer without a sound understanding of data structures. This is the reason, interviewers ask data structure questions in any programming interview. They store data in a specific memory layout and based on what type of problem you are solving it might become necessary to use one data structure versus the other. The few most common data structures are array, linked list, tree, stack, queue, etc. In this video, we will understand what data structures are and their implementations in different programming languages.

We can't measure this using absolute terms such as time in seconds because different computers have different hardware hence we need a mathematical way to measure time complexity of a program and Big O is that mathematical way. The basic idea is to come up with mathematical function for a running time and consider only fastest growing term and discard other terms as well as constants. Big O is used to measure space complexity as well, You will know how to find the time and space complexity of algorithms.

Clarification: At 5:05, the code should be print(str(numbers[i]) + "" is a duplicate""), to concatenate integer with string you need to convert to string or use format string.

822,q9oAZwhuUy4,codebasics,2020-02-01T15:11:47Z,Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist,"Want to know the difference between Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist? Keep watching this video to know. Data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer are three different roles in the field of data science and data analytics. And these three roles can sometimes confuse data science aspirants. 
A data engineer is a software engineer who specializes in data-based technology and is well versed in extracting data from structured and unstructured sources. A data analyst is a person who has domain knowledge, while the data scientist has all the skillset like an analyst, but is also good at statistics and knows deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing. The difference between data analyst vs data scientist, is the expertise in statics. 
A short summary of the difference is that a data engineer is like a raw material you need to prepare any dish, while the data scientist or analyst is the chef who can make the dish.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

In this particular video we will load banglore home prices data into pandas dataframe and than handle NA values. We will than removal some unnecessary features and also normalize property size. We will convert the range of property size (such as 2100-3250) into an average of min and max.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

Step by step approach on learning data science is,

1) Pick a data science project first: you can use kaggle.com datasets or competitions for this. 

2) Learn either python or R programming language. For python you can follow this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykoKxsYtow&list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

3) Once you have basic understanding of python, you need to learn data exploration and data cleaning using pandas. Here is the playlist for pandas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmorAWRsCAw&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy

4) Jupyter notebook is an essential tool that you can use as a code editor. Here is the tutorial on notebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZX_0FMEc

5) matplotlib is widely used for data visualization and for that also I've a playlist of tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqwf4Vuj8oM&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl

6) Once data cleaning and exploration is over, next step is to build machine learning model. For statistical models we can use sklearn library and for deep learning we can use pytorch and google's tensorflow. For machine learning I've created very easy to follow tutorial list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw

Data science is a process of getting insights from data. You don't have to be deep learning expert in order to do data science, you can do that in plain old microsoft excel also (if dataset is small enough). In recent years volume of data has grown too much so that data has become BIG DATA. Microsoft excel can't work with big data hence you need tools such as,

#DataScience #WhatIsDataScience #DataScienceForBeginners #DataScientist #DataScienceTutorial #DataScienceWithPython #DataScienceCourse

1) Apache hadoop and apache spark: For database storage and distributed computing
2) Python and R: For data science programming
3) Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, MATLAB, Jupyter Notebook: For data visualization
4) Sklearn, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, PyTorch: For deep learning and machine learning

Data scientist has become the most popular job in the market today and there is a huge career scope if you know how to do data science. Some of the use cases of data science in real life are,

1) Healthcare: Diagnostic prediction and accuracy
2) Finance: Fraud detection, predictive analysis on loans, stock market movement, company future
3) Shipping: Figure out best route for shipping 
4) E-commerce: Product recommendation, inventory pricing

1) how to hyper tune machine learning model paramers 
2) choose best model for given machine learning problem
We will start by comparing traditional train_test_split approach with k fold cross validation. Then we will see how GridSearchCV helps run K Fold cross validation with its convenient api. GridSearchCV helps find best parameters that gives maximum performance. RandomizedSearchCV is another class in sklearn library that does same thing as GridSearchCV
but without running exhaustive search, this helps with computation time and resources. We will also see how to find best model among all the classification algorithm using GridSearchCV. In the end we have interesting exercise for you to solve.

This tutorial covers some theory first and then goes over python coding to solve iris flower classification problem using svm and sklearn library. We also cover different parameters such as gamma, regularization and how to fine tune svm classifier using these parameters. Basically the way support vector machine works is it draws a hyper plane in n dimension space such that it maximizes  the margin between classification groups.

But how do we handle text information in dataset? Simple approach is to use interger or label encoding but when categorical variables are nominal, using simple label encoding can be problematic. One hot encoding is the technique that can help in this situation. In this tutorial, we will use pandas get_dummies method to create dummy variables that allows us to perform one hot encoding on given dataset. Alternatively we can use sklearn.preprocessing OneHotEncoder as well to create dummy variables.

In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step.

If you are a beginner and just starting out with programming then python is probably the best place to start. Also for experienced programmers, it makes sense to learn python programming because code development speed is very good and one can to fast prototyping. Python is used heavily in data science, machine learning, scientific computing due to its rich set of libraries (modules). So come and learn python with me :)

Topics that are covered in this Video:
0:00 Introduction 
0:08 It is easy to learn and very intuitive programming language
1:02 You can develop code really fast in python whereas with other languages it takes relatively longer time. This is so because,
   * The code syntax is compact
   * There is no compilation. Python is interpreted language so you save time on compiling the code.
   * It has rich set of libraries so for pretty much anything you can just import a library, write couple of lines using that and you are done
2:45 Rich set of libraries or modules
3:24 Used heavily in the fields of data science, machine learning and scientific computing
3:52 Plenty of job opportunities

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video I'm talking about how I use iPad Pro for learning data science. I really enjoy watching videos, reading books, taking study notes and even coding (!) on an iPad. Honestly, I tend to get lazy and procrastinate a lot when working/ studying by myself. This iPad has helped me against procrastination because I actually think it is fun to use it. Even though it costs a lot of money (to me), I still think it's been a great investment overall.

Hey data nerds 👋, greetings from my hometown in Vietnam!! JupyterLab is a great tool for data science, but it has its own limitations.. big ones 😅.. Due to the fact that you can execute cells in different orders, it's easy to make mistakes and mess up the output. From my experience, it could be a big challenge to use JupyterLab in a complex data science project. In this video, I'm sharing with you about Link, a JupyterLab extension that helps us easily create pipelines in JupyterLab and share them with other people. This extension helps address the reproducibility issue of JupyterLab, and makes it easy to share results. While walking you through the how-to of this extension, I also tried to give a brief introduction to neural style transfer algorithm, which is what I implemented in this sample notebook. 

Let me know what you think about this extension and whether you would consider using it in your projects. Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video we made an attempt to extract relationships between The Witcher's characters from the books. We also did some graph analyses (centrality measures and community detection) and visualization using NetworkX and Pyvis. The analyses are still quite preliminary and I might have glossed over some details, but hopefully, this is a bit interesting and you learned something from it 🤓. This is the second project in the Witcher project series where we will analyze the relationships between characters. The next episode of this series will be all about network graph visualization 😁. I hope you enjoyed this video and any questions and thoughts are welcome! Thank you for watching 🙌🏽

What's up, everyone! So today's video is a bit different from my normal talking-head/ tutorial style, attempting to teach you something about data science :). I've been thinking about making this video for a while, as I'm nearing the end of my study. As you probably noticed in some of my older videos I mentioned my BSc Computer Science study next to work, and that's what this video is all about :). I'm sharing here my story of how I came to do that, my motivation, strategies, and some fun demos of what I have created during my study. I hope you found this video entertaining and somewhat informative ;). And, don't forget to check out the nerdy gifts at the end of the video! ;) Thank you for watching!
